This is a training excersise that was made while following The Net Ninja's tutorial on regular expressions.

The goal of this excersise is the creation of a form that takes input from the user and then uses Regex to validate that input, giving feedback to the user along the way.

The exercise demonstrates the use of HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript for the creation of said form.
